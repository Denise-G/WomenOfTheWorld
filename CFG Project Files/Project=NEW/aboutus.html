        <p style="color: rgb(113, 226, 68); margin-left: 2.5em;padding: 0 20em 0; padding-top: 25px;">This project 
            was created during an Introduction To Web Development at Code First: Girls. It is a culmination of all 
            that the inspiring web developers below have learned during the seven week duration, please explore 
            and enjoy our project.</p>

         <h3>Web Developers</h3>

           
            <h5>Atinuke Akindiya</h5>

              <p style="color: rgb(205, 218, 31); margin-left: 2.5em;padding: 0 7em 0;">Atinuke is currently doing her masters 
                at King’s College of London, studying Political Economy of Emerging Markets. I gained an interest in tech, after 
                completing my 
                internship at a business and technology firm. This motivated her to expand my technical/software skills, 
                so she signed up to the Code First Girls Web Development course. Likewise, as a student in the 
                International Development department, she is a a strong advocate for investing in education and 
                sustainability. She believe technology is a great platform to enhance both areas. Therefore, she hope 
                to pursue a career in tech which enables her to use the skills and expertise to improve areas in the 
                developing world.</p>

                <h5>Denise Goldman</h5>

              <p style="color: rgb(205, 218, 31); margin-left: 2.5em;padding: 0 7em 0;">Denise has a background in the 
                visual and performative arts, whilst studying for her MA in Documentary Photography & Photojournalism, 
                she created a documentary highlighting the impact of technology on today’s society. This awakened a 
                realisation that she has always been fascinated by emerging tech, and its capabilities to shape the digital 
                and physical world. 2 years on, she has temporarily put her photographic practice to one side in order to 
                embark on a new adventure, she hopes to one day be able to fuse her background in photography, art, design 
                and dance to create websites, video games and exhibition installation that engage and captivate her audiences.
                Recently, she has been selected for a Technology Graduate Scheme at BT, thanks to the confidence that she has 
                gained whilst researching tech, and later learning to code with Code First: Girls.</p>
